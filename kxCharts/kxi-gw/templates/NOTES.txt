================================

 - Resource Coordinator manages all incoming queries sent via the Service Gateway.
 - Aggregator to combine all data into a single dataset

See docs for more info: https://code.kx.com/insights/microservices/database/query/index.html

Access
======

By default the access points are not exposed outside the cluster for security reasons. To test you can port forward the Service Gateway endpoints to get development access

  $ kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "kxi-gw.fullname" . }}-sg {{.Values.kxiSg.service.ports.http}}:{{.Values.kxiSg.service.ports.http}}
  $ kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "kxi-gw.fullname" . }}-sg {{.Values.kxiSg.service.ports.qipc}}:{{.Values.kxiSg.service.ports.qipc}}

Alternatively by modifying the service type of the Service Gateway to 'Load Balancer' you can expose the Service Gateway externally from the cluster.

In your custom myvalues.yaml address

service:
  type: LoadBalancer
