# kx-sdk-reference-architectures

## Introduction

The KX SDK Reference Architectures contains docker and helm based reference architecture and deployment instructions. The aim is to allow users to quickly deploy Insights SDK architectures to ingest & persist data to the InsightsDB as well as scale horizontally and deploy pipelines with the full featureset of the [Insights SDK](https://code.kx.com/insights/1.16/microservices/index.html) toolset. 

Each reference architecture contains a detailed README on how to deploy the architecture and basic usage instructions. Please visit and register to the [Kx Developer Center](https://developer.kx.com) for further information on Insights SDK with documentation, walk through examples and use cases.
